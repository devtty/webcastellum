This file lists the major changes of the last few WebCastellum releases:

Version 1.8.5
===========================================
- ZipBomb Test considers compression ratio and calculates size


Version 1.8.3 major new features (released on 2009-09-26):
===========================================

- Added feature "flexible configuration loading" to enable the optional externalization
  of configuration data (the filter's init-params of web.xml) into other configuration 
  sources. The new configuration setting "ConfigurationLoader" (default value
  "org.webcastellum.DefaultConfigurationLoader") specifies the classname of
  the loader responsible for loading configuration data (this class implements
  the new interface "org.webcastellum.ConfigurationLoader"). The default
  implementation loads the configuration data from web.xml via filter init-params as usual.
  Another implementation available is "org.webcastellum.PropertiesFileConfigurationLoader",
  which uses a properties file from the filesystem to load configuration data. When using
  this configuration loader the filename of the properties file to hold the configuration values
  must be specified via init-param "PropertiesFileConfigurationLoader_File". Unless you set
  "PropertiesFileConfigurationLoader_FallbackToWebXml" to "false" (default is "true")
  configuration data not found in the properties file will be loaded as a fallback from the
  web.xml file. This way you can externalize (overwrite) certain parts of your configuration
  into properties files and keep other parts still inside the web.xml file.

- Added configuration setting "ConfigurationReinitializationInterval" (default 0) 
  to specify configuration reinitialization intervals (in minutes). This is useful
  when externalizing parts of your configuration out of web.xml into another
  configuration storage and you wan't automatic reconfiguration.

- Improvements for usage of URL encryption within Spring Tiles2/WebFlow
  applications (see README.txt for details)




Version 1.8.2 major new features (released on 2009-08-08):
===========================================

- Added feature "transparent forwarding" to be more transparent for the
  web application when URL encryption is enabled (especially interesting
  for users of the Apache Wicket web framework). This new feature is
  enabled by default and can be disabled (legacy mode) by setting the
  boolean config param "TransparentForwarding" to false)

- Added feature "transparent querystring" to be more transparent for the
  web application when secret token injection is enabled (especially
  interesting for users of the Apache Wicket web framework). This new
  feature is enabled by default and can be disabled (legacy mode) by
  setting the boolean config param "TransparentQuerystring" to false)

- Better integration with reverse proxy infrastructures
  (the "localAddr thing")




Version 1.8.1 major new features (released on 2009-02-28):
===========================================

- Attack logging enhanced with a flexible interface for custom
  integration in alerting systems

- Honeypot-like feature "honeylinks"

- Performance optimizations for response protection
