## Reporting a Security Issue or Vulnerability

The following ways to report (security related) issues are possible:

- send a mail to denis@devtty.de
- add an issue to this repository
- or use :octocat: security advisory feature but think before: _not every security issue is a vulnerability_ 

This is currently a private (spare time) project, so let me know the issues but don't expected to much (and fast resolutions)
